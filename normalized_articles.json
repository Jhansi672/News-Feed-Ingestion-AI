    "text": "Pope expresses sadness after Israeli strike on Gaza church kills three\n\n3 hours ago Share Save Yolande Knell & David Gritten BBC News Reporting from Jerusalem Share Save\n\nReuters Father Gabriele Romanelli was among those who needed medical treatment\n\nPope Leo XIV has renewed his call for a Gaza ceasefire after three people sheltering in the Catholic church in Gaza City were killed in an Israeli strike. A telegram said the Pope was \"deeply saddened to learn of the loss of life and injury caused by the military attack\" on the Holy Family Church. The Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem, which oversees the church, said it was \"struck by the Israeli army\". Nine other people were wounded, one of whom is in a critical condition in hospital. The parish priest was lightly injured. Israel's foreign ministry said it regretted any harm to a religious site or uninvolved civilians and the Israeli military said the incident was under review.\n\nMany displaced families from Gaza's small Christian community have been living in the church compound since the war began after their own homes were destroyed. While he was alive, the late Pope Francis called them on a near-daily basis. A video and photos shared with the BBC showed the roof of the Holy Family Church was hit, close to the cross, and that windows were broken. TV footage showed the Argentine parish priest, Father Gabriele Romanelli, walking unsteadily and checking on a man on a stretcher at the Al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City. The Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, told the Vatican News website that the Holy Family Church was hit by a tank shell. \"What we know for sure is that a tank, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] says by mistake, but we are not sure about this. They hit the church directly,\" he said. The charity Caritas Jerusalem said the shell hit the church roof, \"scattering shrapnel and debris across the yard\". \"At the time, some individuals were outside the main building, including two elderly women who were sitting inside our Caritas psychosocial support tent. Both were severely wounded and were transported by ambulance to Al-Ahli Hospital after a 15-minute delay,\" it said. \"Three young people who had been standing at the entrance of the church were also badly injured and were rushed to the hospital using private vehicles.\" Later, the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem announced that \"three individuals lost their lives as a result of the injuries sustained and nine others were wounded, including one in critical condition and two in serious condition\". Two of those killed were identified by Caritas Jerusalem as Saad Salameh, the 60-year-old parish janitor, and Fumayya Ayyad, an 84-year-old woman. The Vatican's secretary of state sent a telegram to the victims saying Pope Leo was deeply saddened by the loss of life and had assured Father Romanelli \"and the whole parish community of his spiritual closeness\". \"His holiness renews his call for an immediate ceasefire, and he expresses his profound hope for dialogue, reconciliation and enduring peace in the region,\" it added.\n\nCaritas Jerusalem Caritas Jerusalem said a shell hit the church roof, scattering shrapnel and debris across the yard",

    "text": "Tomorrowland organisers plan to build new stage after fire destroys original\n\n10 minutes ago Share Save James Gregory BBC News Share Save\n\nFire engulfs main stage of Tomorrowland music festival\n\nTomorrowland festival in Belgium plans to build a new main stage in time for the start of this weekend's event, organisers have said a day after a fire completely destroyed the original platform. Organisers say the festival, in the town of Boom, south of Antwerp, will begin two hours later than originally planned on Friday with or without a new stage. If they have not managed to secure a new stage then the event will open in a reduced capacity, with plans to fully open on Saturday. Some 400,000 people are expected to attend the electronic dance music festival over two weekends, with tens of thousands having already arrived at the Dreamville campsite to stay overnight.\n\nHundreds of artists, including David Guetta, Lost Frequencies, Swedish House Mafia and Charlotte De Witte are expected to perform. Nobody was injured in Wednesday evening's fire and experts are working to determine a cause. The local fire service has declared the site safe. At a press conference on Thursday evening, Tomorrowland spokeswoman Debby Wilmsen said they hoped a \"nice, new stage\" would be ready for Friday. If not, Dreamville and the festival grounds will function as two separate areas on Friday. Artists scheduled to perform the main stage will instead play on the Gathering Stage at the campsite. People camping will also not be able to access the rest of the festival grounds in this scenario. Bradley Cooper-Barnard drove from London to Belgium with three other friends. \"This is my fourth Tomorrowland and things definitely feel a little different,\" he told the BBC before the latest announcement. \"Dreamville itself feels very much subdued, there's a bit of a sombre feeling around. In all of my previous years by this time of the day people are partying and there's usually music everywhere - it's quite quiet but a good amount of people around,\" he said. \"We've got our tents set up and we're going to have a great time come what may.\"\n\nBradley Cooper-Barnard Bradley Cooper-Barnard and his friends are determined to enjoy the experience\n\nIn an Instagram on Thursday morning, Tomorrowland said: \"It is impossible to put into words what we're feeling.\" It added that the Orbyz main stage \"wasn't just a stage... it was was living breathing world\". Meetings were held on Thursday between festival organisers, safety experts and local government officials to discuss contingency plans. There are 14 other stages at the festival, all much smaller than the main stage.\n\nGetty Images",

The blaze at the mall, which opened seven days ago, broke out on Wednesday night and has since been brought under control. Videos posted on social media showed firefighters rescuing people from the mall's roof, but state media reported that many were still missing. \"A tragedy and a calamity has befallen us,\" regional governor Mohammed al-Miyahi said, adding that legal action would be brought against the shopping centre's owner. The cause of the fire was not immediately known.\n\nThe governor has also declared three days of mourning. Videos on INA's news channel show flames ripping through several floors of the Corniche Hypermarket in the city's centre, as firefighters try to douse them. Other clips circulating on social media appear to show a small number of people on the roof during the fire, as well as the burned out insides of the centre. A number of people were rescued from the building by firefighters, al-Miyahi told local media. Ambulances were still taking casualties to hospitals in the city, which is about 160 km (100 miles) southeast of Baghdad, at 04:00 local time. \"The tragic fire claimed the lives of 61 innocent citizens, most of whom suffocated in bathrooms, and among them 14 charred bodies yet to be identified,\" the interior ministry said in a statement. It added that 45 people were rescued from inside the building.",

But it is not clear whether that will hold.\n\nIn his first televised statement since Israel's air strikes on Damascus on Wednesday, Ahmed al-Sharaa also warned that Syrians were not afraid of war.\n\nSyria's interim president has said it is his \"priority\" to protect the country's Druze citizens, after Israel vowed to destroy government forces it accused of attacking members of the religious minority in Suweida province.\n\nHowever, the fighting escalated and government forces were accused by residents and activists of killing Druze civilians and carrying out extrajudicial executions.\n\nThe government responded by deploying its forces to the predominantly Druze city of Suweida for the first time since Sharaa's Sunni Islamist group led the rebel offensive that overthrew President Bashar al-Assad in December, ending 13 years of civil war.\n\nWho are the Druze and why is Israel attacking Syria?\n\nThe Druze religion is an offshoot of Shia Islam with its own unique identity and beliefs. In addition to Syria, there are sizeable communities of Druze in Lebanon, Jordan, Israel and the occupied Golan Heights.\n\nSyrian Druze and other minorities have remained suspicious of Sharaa since he took power because of his jihadist past. His Islamist group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), is a former al-Qaeda affiliate that is still designated as a terrorist organisation by the UN.\n\nTheir fears have been heightened by several outbreaks of deadly sectarian violence, including one in May between Druze militias, security forces and allied Islamist fighters that also prompted Israel intervene militarily.\n\nIn his speech early on Thursday, Sharaa stressed that the Druze were \"a fundamental part of the fabric of this nation\", and that he rejected any attempt for them to be dragged into the hands of what he called \"an external party\".\n\nThe president said government forces deployed to Suweida had \"succeeded in restoring stability and expelling outlawed factions despite the Israeli interventions\", which he said caused a \"significant complication of the situation\" and \"a large-scale escalation\".\n\n\"We are not among those who fear the war. We have spent our lives facing challenges and defending our people, but we have put the interests of the Syrians before chaos and destruction,\" he said.\n\nResponsibility for security in Suweida would now be handed to religious elders and some local factions \"based on the supreme national interest\", he added.\n\nSharaa ended the speech by promising that the government was \"keen on holding accountable those who transgressed and abused our Druze people\".\n\nOn Wednesday, Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, told the country's own Druze citizens that Israeli forces were \"acting to save our Druze brothers and to eliminate the gangs of the regime\".\n\nThe Israeli military said its aircraft struck the Syrian military's headquarters in Damascus and a military site near the presidential palace, as well as armoured vehicles on their way to Suweida, and firing posts and weapons storage facilities in southern Syria.\n\n\"We are acting decisively to prevent the entrenchment of hostile elements beyond the border, to protect the citizens of the State of Israel, and to prevent the harming of Druze civilians,\" the military's chief of staff, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, said during a visit to the Golan Heights.\n\n\"We will not allow southern Syria to become a terror stronghold,\" he warned.\n\nThe general also said there was \"no room for disorder near the border fence\", after hundreds of Druze crossed the heavily fortified frontier with Syria on Wednesday.\n\nThe US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, said it was speaking to all of the parties involved and had \"agreed on specific steps that will bring this troubling and horrifying situation to an end\".\n\n\"This will require all parties to deliver on the commitments they have made and this is what we fully expect them to do,\" he added, without giving any details.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a UK-based monitoring group, says more than 350 people have been killed since Sunday.\n\nThey include 79 Druze fighters and 55 civilians, 27 of whom were summarily killed by interior ministry and defence ministry forces, according to the group.\n\nAt least 189 members of the government forces and 18 Bedouin tribal fighters have also been killed in the clashes, it says.\n\nIt was not immediately possible to verify the SOHR's casualty figures, but Syrian security sources also said Wednesday that the death toll was close to 300.",

    "text": "Wig ban only lasts a day in Senegal theatre after backlash\n\n43 minutes ago Share Save Nicolas Negoce & Natasha Booty BBC News Share Save\n\nAFP via Getty Images Wigs are ever-popular in Senegal - as sported here by supermodel Naomi Campbell at a recent fashion show in Dakar\n\nA sudden and swiftly reversed ban on wigs, hair extensions, and skin-lightening products at an iconic theatre in Senegal's capital, Dakar, has ignited a widespread public backlash - laying bare deep tensions around identity, gender politics, and cultural nationalism in the West African nation. The internal memo was stamped by the national culture ministry and issued on Monday by Serigne Fall Guèye, director of the Grand Théâtre de Dakar. He said the move was to \"promote Pan-African values\" and protect the institution's cultural image. But critics accused Guèye of policing women's bodies under the guise of cultural pride, and the ban was reversed the following day.\n\nFeminist groups and civil society leaders said the memo reflected broader concerns about gender inequality in Senegal, especially given the low number of women in President Bassirou Diomaye Faye's administration - four out of 25 - and the removal of the Ministry of Women. Many social media users criticised the ban as sexist, invasive, and paternalistic. The controversy was further complicated by Serigne Fall Guèye's own political background. Before being appointed to the Grand Théâtre in early 2024, Guèye was a prominent figure in Pastef - the ruling party known for its anti-colonial, pan-Africanist rhetoric. At the time, he led the party's artistic and cultural commission, championing a return to what he called \"authentic African values\". Critics fear that Guèye's personal ideology is now bleeding into what should be a neutral public entity. \"This isn't about wigs or skin,\" political analyst Fatoumata Ba tells the BBC. \"It's about a broader power play - using state institutions to impose a particular version of identity, while silencing or sidelining anyone who doesn't conform.\"\n\nAFP via Getty Images Braids using extensions - as seen here on Senegalese designer Adama Paris - are a very popular style\n\nOne of the most widely shared responses came from Henriette Niang Kandé, a feminist analyst and public intellectual, who questioned the logic and intent behind the ban in a viral social media post, saying: \"As for [hair] grafts and wigs, should we remind this director that these are aesthetic choices, sometimes economical, often practical? Are we forbidding men from shaving their heads to hide baldness? From wearing false collars to lengthen their necks?\" Supporters of the now-cancelled ban, though in the minority, argue that the director's intention was rooted in cultural pride, not oppression. Guèye himself defended the memo as part of a broader mission to \"restore African dignity and identity\", particularly in the arts sector, which he believes has been overly influenced by Eurocentric beauty standards. Yet critics say such policies reduce cultural pride to physical appearance - while ignoring deeper systemic issues. \"If you truly want to affirm African identity,\" sociologist Mame Diarra Thiam tells the BBC, \"start with language, education, economic justice - not banning weaves and skin [lightening] cream\". By Tuesday, facing mounting pressure, Serigne Fall Guèye was forced to reverse the ban, citing public misunderstanding and reiterating his commitment to the theatre's mission. But the damage had already been done. It has exposed growing discontent with Pastef founder and Prime Minister Ousmane Sonko among the urban youth and progressive civil society, who supported him in the 2024 elections but now feel betrayed by his government's perceived conservatism and centralisation of power. At its core, the wig and bleaching ban at the Grand Théâtre was not just about aesthetics - it was about who gets to define cultural authenticity, and at what cost. In a country where skin-lightening products remain popular despite known health risks, and where women's appearance is often subject to moral scrutiny, the debate is far from superficial. It touches on post-colonial identity, gender inequality, economic necessity, and personal freedom. For now, the ban is gone - but the broader debates it sparked remain very much alive.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nGetty Images/BBC",

The interior ministry will handle elections in the future, state-run RTB TV reported. Since seizing power in September 2022, the coup leaders have initiated sweeping reforms, including the postponement of elections which would lead to a return to civilian rule. A nationwide vote was due last year, but the junta extended the period of transition to democracy until July 2029, allowing leader Capt Ibrahim Traoré to remain in power and free to contest the next presidential election.\n\nThe AFP news agency quotes Territorial Administration Minister Emile Zerbo as saying that the electoral commission was \"subsidised\" with around $870,000 (£650,000) a year. Abolishing the commission would \"reinforce our sovereign control on the electoral process and at the same time limit foreign influences\", he added.\n\nAfter coming to power three years ago amid criticism that the civilian authorities were failing to deal with a growing Islamist insurgency, the military leaders have rejected the assistance of former colonial power France in favour of Russia. Rights groups have since accused the army of targeting civilians in its attempt to quash the militants, as well as suppressing political activity and the freedom of expression. There are also question marks over the effectiveness of the military operation. In the first half of 2025, jihadist group JNIM said it had carried out over 280 attacks in Burkina Faso – double the number for the same period in 2024, according to data verified by the BBC.

    "text": "US says 'specific steps' agreed to end Syria violence after Israeli strikes hit Damascus\n\n14 hours ago Share Save David Gritten BBC News Reporting from Jerusalem Share Save\n\nWatch: How a day of bombing unfolded in Damascus\n\nIsrael's military struck the Syrian defence ministry in Damascus and government forces in southern Syria for a third day on Wednesday, as deadly sectarian fighting in the mostly Druze province of Suweida continued. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it was \"working to save our Druze brothers\". Interim Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa accused Israel of causing a \"large-scale escalation\". More than 350 people are reported to have been killed since Sunday, when clashes between Druze militias and Bedouin tribes erupted in Suweida. The Syrian military reportedly began to withdraw its forces from Suweida late on Wednesday, as the US said it had agreed \"steps\" to end the violence.\n\n\"We have agreed on specific steps that will bring this troubling and horrifying situation to an end tonight,\" US Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote on X. Syria's state news agency, Sana, reported that troops were leaving Suweida as part of an agreement between the government and the Suweida's religious leaders, following the \"completion of the army's pursuit of outlaw groups\". The Syrian foreign ministry said the country \"welcomes the efforts made by the US and Arabian sides\" to \"resolve the current crisis\" peacefully. Israel has not yet commented on the ceasefire efforts. The Israeli military began striking Syrian security forces and their weapons on Monday, after they were deployed to the city of Suweida for the first time since Sunni Islamist-led rebels overthrew President Bashar al-Assad in December.\n\nMinority groups including the Druze - whose religion is an offshoot of Shia Islam with its own unique identity and beliefs - are suspicious of Sharaa and his government, despite his pledges to protect them. Their fears have been heightened by several outbreaks of sectarian violence over the past eight months, including one in May in which dozens of people were reportedly killed in clashes between Druze, security forces, and allied Islamist fighters in Damascus and Suweida. In the wake of that fighting, the government reached an agreement with Druze militias to hire local security forces in Suweida province from their ranks. The continued control of Suweida by the militias sparked tensions with Bedouin tribes backed by the government. Netanyahu has said he is committed to preventing harm to the Druze in Syria because of their deep ties to those living in Israel and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Hundreds of Druze crossed the heavily fortified frontier with Syria on Wednesday, prompting Israeli troops to fire tear-gas in an attempt to stop them. Netanyahu urged those with Israeli citizenship to \"return to your homes and let the [Israeli military] take action\".\n\nIsrael said the significant escalation of its bombing campaign was aimed at making the Syrian government immediately withdraw its forces from Suweida province. Defence Minister Israel Katz wrote on X on Wednesday afternoon that \"the warnings in Damascus\" had ended and that the Israeli military would \"continue to operate vigorously in Suweida to destroy the forces that attacked the Druze until they withdraw completely\". He later posted that \"the painful blows have begun\", above a video clip showing a TV presenter diving under a desk live on camera as an Israeli air strike hit the nearby entrance to the Syrian defence ministry in Umayyad Square, in central Damascus – where huge crowds celebrated Assad's downfall last year. A separate strike on what the Israeli military called a \"military target in the area\" of the presidential palace underscored the severity of Israel's warning to Sharaa. Fadi Al Halabi, a London-based Syrian filmmaker who is visiting Damascus, said he was nearby when he heard the Israeli fighter jets approach. \"People's faces were so afraid. Everyone started running [in] the street. No-one knew where to go. Suddenly the air strike[s] began, targeting some of the most crowded areas, including the ministry of defence,\" he told the BBC. The Israeli military said it also struck armoured vehicles loaded with heavy machine guns and weapons on their way to Suweida, and firing posts and weapons storage facilities in southern Syria. Syria's foreign ministry said the strikes targeted government institutions and civilian facilities in Damascus and Suweida and killed \"several innocent civilians\". \"This flagrant assault, which forms part of a deliberate policy pursued by the Israeli entity to inflame tensions, spread chaos, and undermine security and stability in Syria, constitutes a blatant violation of the United Nations Charter and international humanitarian law,\" it added. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a UK-based monitoring group, meanwhile reported that the humanitarian situation in Suweida city had rapidly deteriorated. It cited sources as saying there were clashes in several area of the city and that tanks had attacked the national hospital, causing panic among the scores of casualties from the fighting being treated there. They also said there were acute shortages of water and medical supplies. Later, the Syrian health ministry said government forces had entered the hospital and found \"dozens of bodies\" after \"outlaw groups withdrew\", according to the official Sana news agency. A man named Hosam told the BBC he was in the centre of Suweida city and had witnessed civilians coming under fire from artillery and snipers. \"I lost my neighbour today on the street. One of the snipers shot him. We tried to [get an] ambulance [to take] him to hospital, but we couldn't,\" he said. Other witnesses and local activists have described scenes of looting and extrajudicial killings. The SOHR says more than 350 people have been killed since Sunday in Suweida province. They include 79 Druze fighters and 55 civilians, 27 of whom were summarily killed by interior ministry and defence ministry forces, according to the group. At least 189 members of the government forces and 18 Bedouin tribal fighters have also been killed in the clashes, it says. It was not immediately possible to verify the SOHR's casualty figures, but Syrian security sources also told the BBC on Wednesday that the death toll was close to 300.\n\nReuters The Syrian interior ministry said a ceasefire had been agreed on Wednesday night to end the fighting in Suweida city",

It is not clear why Maurene Comey was removed from her job at the Southern District of New York. But a day after she was fired, Comey told former colleagues that \"fear is the tool of a tyrant, wielded to supress independent thought\". She is the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, who was fired by President Donald Trump in 2017. The justice department has been firing lawyers who worked on cases that angered the president, including a special prosecutor investigation of Trump.\n\nMs Comey - who had been a trial lawyer at the high-profile justice department office in Manhattan since 2015 - was given no explanation for her firing, US media report. \"If a career prosecutor can be fired without reason, fear may seep into the decisions of those who remain. Do not let that happen,\" according to a copy of a message she sent to former colleagues, first reported by Politico. \"Instead of fear, let this moment fuel the fire that already burns at the heart of this place,\" Ms Comey added. \"A fire of righteous indignation at abuses of power. Of commitment to seek justice for victims. Of dedication to truth above all else.\" Her exit comes as Trump and the justice department's leader, Attorney General Pam Bondi, face backlash over the administration's handling of files relating to Epstein. Trump's Epstein strategy could pit him against loyal supporters Epstein, the well-connected convicted paedophile, died by suicide in a New York jail while awaiting trial in 2019. Bondi appeared to indicate in February she would release Epstein's client list, before saying last week there was no \"incriminating list\" and no further files would be disclosed. On Wednesday, Trump fired off his strongest rebuke yet on social media at supporters who claim there has been a cover-up on Epstein, labelling them \"weaklings\" and saying he did not want their backing anymore.\n\nWatch: Trump calls out \"stupid Republicans\" in Jeffrey Epstein files saga\n\nMs Comey's firing comes after her prosecution team failed in their bid to convict Sean Combs on the most serious charges he faced of racketeering and sex-trafficking. The rapper was found guilty this month of lesser counts. According to ABC News, Trump has privately expressed displeasure about having a Comey work in his administration. Her father, James Comey, was recently interviewed by the US Secret Service after posting - then deleting - a seashell photo on Instagram that federal officials alleged was a call for violence against Trump. Earlier this month it was reported that the justice department had launched an investigation into the former FBI director. Prosecutors were said to be examining Comey's statements to Congress over an inquiry into alleged Russian attempts to influence the 2016 White House election. That probe failed to find Trump had criminally conspired with the Kremlin. The BBC has contacted the justice department for comment. The agency has been purging officials since the Republican president returned to office in January. Last week Bondi fired at least 20 staff who had roles in Special Counsel Jack Smith's twin investigations into Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 presidential election defeat and the alleged mishandling of classified documents found at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. A number of prosecutors who charged participants in the US Capitol riot, when Trump supporters stormed Congress, have also been sacked.",

    "text": "At least 20 killed in crush at US-backed GHF aid site in Gaza\n\n1 day ago Share Save David Gritten BBC News Reporting from Jerusalem Share Save\n\nReuters Casualties from the incident were brought to Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis\n\nAt least 20 people have been killed in a crush at an aid distribution centre in southern Gaza run by the US- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), the organisation and a local hospital say. The GHF said 19 were trampled to death and one was stabbed \"amid a chaotic and dangerous surge\" at its site in the Khan Younis area. It added that it believed people \"armed and affiliated with Hamas\" fomented unrest. But Gaza's Hamas-run Government Media Office denied the claim and accused the GHF of trying to \"cover up\" a crime. Nasser hospital in Khan Younis said it had received the bodies of 21 people who died from suffocation as a result of tear gas inhalation and a crush at the aid site.\n\nIt is the first time the GHF has confirmed deaths at one of its aid sites.\n\nIn a graphic video shared on social media and verified by the BBC, a witness standing on a cart filled with the bodies of six boys and men at Nasser hospital said they had been crushed between fences set up at the GHF site while waiting for food handouts on Wednesday. \"They are children. What is it their fault dying for aid?\" the man shouts as he holds up the body of one of the boys. \"What happened is [that] at the door of the aid [site], the foreigners made a fence here and a fence here,\" he gestured. \"The boys went to the front and the people came and stepped on them.\" One injured man being treated at the hospital, Mahmoud Fojo, 21, said that when he reached the GHF site he found that contractors were \"closing the gates\". \"People kept gathering and pressuring each other. When people pushed each other, those who couldn't bear it fell down under the people and got run over,\" he told Reuters news agency. \"Those who couldn't stand fell under the people and were crushed. Some people started jumping over the wire fence and got wounded.\" Another man, Ahmed Abu Omra, said armed contractors standing near the narrow passageways into which the crowds were funnelled had fired \"pepper bombs\". The Government Media Office accused the security contractors of causing the crush by closing the gates of the site after thousands of people had gathered in narrow channels, and then firing canisters of tear gas and live rounds towards them. A GHF spokesperson said the claim was \"completely false\". \"At no point was tear gas deployed, nor were shots fired into the crowd. Limited use of pepper spray was deployed, only to safeguard against additional loss of life. \"In at least one instance, an American worker physically entered the violent crowd to rescue a child who was being trampled,\" they added. At a press briefing later on Wednesday, the first it has staged, GHF spokesperson Chapin Fay said the deadly incident was \"instigated by armed Hamas operatives who infiltrated\" the crowd and \"deliberately incited chaos that led to 20 deaths\". He added that the individual who was stabbed was a medic who had attempted to tackle an armed \"Hamas affiliate\".",

    "text": "Plans for direct train to Berlin in new UK-Germany treaty\n\n2 hours ago Share Save Jennifer McKiernan • @_JennyMcKiernan Political reporter, BBC News Becky Morton Political reporter Share Save\n\nEPA\n\nThe UK and Germany have agreed a plan to create a new, direct rail link between London and Berlin as part of a wide-ranging treaty. The Kensington Treaty also includes opening e-gates for frequent travellers between the two countries next month, as well as agreeing school exchange visits. Friedrich Merz made his first official visit to the UK as German chancellor to sign the deal, which will also tighten laws around people smuggling gangs and strengthen defence ties. Downing Street said the move will make it easier for German authorities to investigate and act against warehouses and storage facilities used by smugglers to conceal small boats intended for illegal Channel crossings to the UK.\n\nThe new travel arrangements come as part of plans to re-set relations around trade and business between the two countries. A joint taskforce will be established for transport experts from both governments to examine how to establish the necessary border and security controls for direct long-distance rail passenger services. Transport Secretary, Heidi Alexander, said the rail link could offer an alternative to flying within the next decade. \"We're pioneering a new era of European rail connectivity and are determined to put Britain at the heart of a better-connected continent,\" she said. \"The Brandenburg Gate, the Berlin Wall and Checkpoint Charlie - in just a matter of years, rail passengers in the UK could be able to visit these iconic sights direct from the comfort of a train, thanks to a direct connection linking London and Berlin. \"This landmark agreement - part of a new treaty the prime minister [has signed] with Chancellor Merz today - has the potential to fundamentally change how millions of people travel between our two countries, offering a faster, more convenient and significantly greener alternative to flying.\" Merz met Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer at the Victoria and Albert Museum in Kensington for the signing ceremony. Sir Keir described the pact as \"evidence of the closeness of our relationship as it stands today\" as well as a \"statement of intent, a statement of our ambition to work ever more closely together\". Commercial investments in the UK, worth more than £200m and expected to create more than 600 new jobs, have been announced, and a new UK-Germany Business Forum has been established. Defence and security was also a key part of discussions, including support for Ukraine, and a new agreement on the joint export of co-produced military equipment has been unveiled. Downing Street said the agreement on equipment such as Boxer armoured vehicles and Typhoon jets was likely to lead to billions of pounds of additional defence exports in the coming years.\n\nOn security, Merz has committed to changing the law, making facilitation of illegal migration to the UK a criminal offence, by the end of the year. Facilitating people-smuggling is not technically illegal in Germany currently, if it is to a country outside the European Union - which, following Brexit, includes the UK. A BBC investigation last year exposed the significant German connection to small boat crossings, with the country becoming a central location for the storage of boats and engines. Sir Keir said: \"Chancellor Merz's commitment to make necessary changes to German law to disrupt the supply lines of the dangerous vessels which carry illegal migrants across the Channel is hugely welcome.\" The German agreement comes a week after the UK announced a new pilot returns scheme with France, during President Emmanuel Macron's state visit. Under the \"one in, one out\" deal, some small boat arrivals would be returned to France in exchange for the UK accepting an equivalent number of asylum seekers with connections to the UK. The prime minister is under pressure to tackle the number of people crossing the Channel in small boats. More than 21,000 people have made the dangerous journey so far this year - a 56% increase on the same period in 2024. The Conservatives' shadow home secretary Chris Philp said the figures showed \"the crisis in the Channel continues to spiral\". \"This is just more of the same tired, headline-chasing from Keir Starmer. \"This government has clearly lost control of our borders and left the country exposed when they cancelled our returns deterrent.\"",

Russia has not commented.\n\nMore than 50 shops, 300 apartments and eight cars were damaged in the attack on Wednesday evening, regional governor Vadym Filashkin said on Telegram.\n\nAt least two people have been killed and a further 27 injured following a Russian air strike on a shopping centre and market in the town of Dobropillia in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region, officials have said.\n\n\"The Russians have again deliberately targeted an area where there are lots of people - a shopping centre in the middle of town,\" governor Filashkin wrote on Telegram on Wednesday.\n\n\"This time with a 500-kg (1,100-pound) air bomb.\"\n\nFilashkin said the bomb had been dropped at 17:20 local time (14:20 GMT) when the area was busy with people out shopping.\n\nSituated 20km (12 miles) from the frontline, and north-east of the city of Pokrovsk - a focal point of Russia's slow advance through the Donetsk region - Dobropillia has been subject to other attacks since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nIn March, a rocket, drone and missile attack killed 11 people in the town, including five children.\n\nMeanwhile, Moscow's Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said Russia's defence ministry had shot down three drones flying towards the capital in the early hours of Thursday morning.\n\nHe said emergency service were working at the site of the wreckage but he did not mention casualties.

Trump says Coca-Cola to change key US ingredient\n\n19 hours ago Share Save Ana Faguy BBC News, Washington DC Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nPresident Donald Trump says Coca-Cola has agreed to use real cane sugar in its drinks sold in the US. Coca-Cola uses corn syrup in its American products, but Trump's Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr has voiced concern about the ingredient's health impacts. \"I have been speaking to Coca-Cola about using REAL Cane Sugar in Coke in the United States, and they have agreed to do so,\" Trump wrote on social media. \"I'd like to thank all of those in authority at Coca-Cola.\" Without explicitly confirming the recipe tweak, a Coca-Cola spokesperson said they \"appreciate President Trump's enthusiasm\" and \"more details on new innovative offerings within our Coca-Cola product range will be shared soon\".\n\nTrump said in Wednesday's post on Truth Social: \"This will be a very good move by them - You'll see. It's just better!\" While Coke sold in the US is typically sweetened with corn syrup, in many other countries it is sweetened in different ways - for example, Mexico uses cane sugar. In April, Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey told investors that \"we continue to make progress on sugar reduction in our beverages\". He said the Atlanta-based company has \"done this by changing recipes as well as by using our global marketing resources and distribution network to boost awareness of and interest in our ever-expanding portfolio\". But any decision to use cane sugar instead might leave a bitter aftertaste for American corn farmers. Corn Refiners Association President and CEO John Bode said in a statement: \"Replacing high fructose corn syrup with cane sugar would cost thousands of American food manufacturing jobs, depress farm income, and boost imports of foreign sugar, all with no nutritional benefit.\" The US health secretary and his Make America Healthy Again movement have advocated for companies to remove ingredients such as corn syrup, seed oils and artificial dyes from their products, linking them to a litany of health problems. Kennedy has also been critical of the amount of sugar Americans consume and reportedly plans to update nationwide dietary guidelines this summer. Trump is a regular drinker of Diet Coke - which uses the artificial sweetener aspartame. He had a button installed in the Oval Office's Resolute desk so he can be served the soda.",

Nina Kutina was rescued on 9 July by policemen who were on a routine patrol near Ramteertha hills in the Gokarna forest, which borders the tourist paradise of Goa. Authorities say the 40-year-old and her daughters - six and five years old - do not have valid documents to stay in India. They have been lodged in a detention centre for foreigners near Bengaluru, the state capital, and will be deported soon. Kutina has defended her lifestyle in two video interviews to Indian news agency ANI, saying she and her children were happy living in the cave and that \"nature gives good health\". But even a week after they were found, there is very little clarity on how the woman and her children came to be in a forest infested with snakes and wild animals; how long they had been living there and who they really are.\n\nPolice stumble on the cave dwelling\n\n\"The area is popular with tourists, especially foreigners. But it has a lot of snakes and it's prone to landslides, especially during the rainy season. To ensure the safety of tourists, we started patrolling the forests last year,\" M Narayana, superintendent of police for Uttara Kannada district, told the BBC. A second policeman who cannot be named and was part of the patrol party that stumbled on the cave dwelling said they walked down a steep hill to investigate when they saw bright clothes that had been hung outdoors to dry. When they got closer to the cave - the entrance to which had been curtained off with brightly coloured saris - \"a little blonde girl came running out\". When the shocked policemen followed her inside, they found Nina Kutina and the other child. Their possessions were meagre - plastic mats, clothes, packets of instant noodles and some other grocery items - and the cave was leaking. Videos shot by the police at the cave dwelling which the BBC has seen, show the children dressed in colourful Indian clothes, smiling into the camera. \"The woman and her children appeared quite comfortable in the place,\" Mr Narayana said. \"It took us some time to convince her that it was dangerous to live there,\" he added. Police said when they told her that the cave was unsafe because of the presence of snakes and wild animals in the forest, she told them: \"Animals and snakes are our friends. Humans are dangerous.\" Kutina and her daughters were taken to a hospital for a check-up after their rescue and were certified to be medically fit.\n\nWho is Nina Kutina?\n\nANI Nina Kutina has said she was born in Russia but hasn't lived there for 15 years\n\nAn official in India's Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) has told the BBC that she's Russian and that she will be repatriated once the formalities are completed. He says they have reached out to the Russian consulate in Chennai - the BBC has also written to the Russian embassy in Delhi but they are yet to respond. In video interviews with India's ANI and PTI news agencies, Kutina said she was born in Russia but hadn't lived there for 15 years and travelled to \"a lot of countries, Costa Rica, Malaysia, Bali, Thailand, Nepal, Ukraine\". In her interviews with both agencies, Kutina said she had four children between the ages of 20 and 5 years. She talked about the eldest - \"my big son\" - who died in a road accident in Goa last year. Officials say her second son is 11-years-old and is in Russia - and that they have shared the information with the consulate. On Tuesday night, the FRRO said they had tracked down the father of the girls - Dror Goldstein - and that he was an Israeli businessman. They said he was in India at the moment and that they met him and were trying to persuade him to pay for Kutina and her daughters' repatriation. On Wednesday, Goldstein told India's NDTV channel that Kutina had left Goa without informing him and that he had lodged a missing complaint with the police there. He said he wanted joint custody of his daughters and would do everything to prevent the government from sending them to Russia.\n\nWhen did she come to Gokarna?\n\nThere is no clarity on how and when Kutina and her daughters reached the forest in Karnataka. Police said she told them that they had been living in the cave for a week. They added that she had bought some vegetables and groceries, including a popular brand of instant noodles, from a local store, a week ago. They said she told them that she arrived in Karnataka from Goa where she also claimed to have lived in a cave. She also said that one of her daughters was born in a Goa cave. In her interview to PTI on Wednesday, she complained about the detention centre where she's been lodged with her daughters saying \"it is like jail\". \"We lived in a very good place. But now we cannot be alone. We cannot go outside. Here it's very dirty, and there's not enough food,\" she added. It's not clear when and how Kutina came to India. Police say she told them she had lost her passport, but they were able to find an older expired passport among her belongings which showed that she had come to India on a business visa which was valid from 18 October 2016 to 17 April 2017. But she overstayed, was caught a year later, and the Goa office of the FRRO issued her \"an exit permit\" to leave India. According to immigration stamps in her passport, she entered Nepal on 19 April 2018 and exited three months later. It's not clear where she went after that, but Kutina told ANI that overall she had \"travelled to at least 20 countries\" - at least \"four of them since leaving India in 2018\". It's also not clear when she returned to India next, although some reports say she's been back since February 2020. She told PTI that she returned because \"we really love India\". Kutina admitted that her visa expired a few months back. \"We don't have our visa, valid visa, our visa finished,\" she said, adding that the lapse happened because she was grieving for her dead son and couldn't think of anything else.\n\nWhy was Kutina living in a cave?\n\nKarnataka police The entrance to the cave where Kutina was living with her daughters had been curtained off with brightly coloured saris",

Air raid sirens rang out across the metropolitan area and in some areas residents sought shelter indoors, while traffic ground to a halt. The city also held mass evacuation drills and mass casualty event rehearsals. The exercise was held in conjunction with Taiwan's largest ever war games - the annual Han Kuang exercises - as the island increasingly attempts to ramp up its defences. China claims self-ruled Taiwan as its part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to \"reunify\" with the island.\n\nGetty Images Soldiers rehearsed an urban warfare scenario in Taichung city on Wednesday\n\nTensions have increased since last year when Taiwan elected its president William Lai, whom China reviles as a \"separatist\". Thursday's event was attended by Lai, government and city officials, and foreign officials including Raymond Greene, the head of the American Institute of Taiwan which serves as a de facto US embassy on the island. In a speech at the end of the exercise, Lai stressed the importance of unity and resilience of Taiwan's society to protect the island and its democratic values. He also stressed that the Han Kuang and Urban Resilience exercises were aimed at building up Taiwan's defences and that the island was not seeking war. \"We hope by preparing for war, we can avoid war, to achieve the goal of peace,\" he said. \"With preparation, we have strength.\" China has criticised the exercises as \"a bluff and self-deceiving stance\" by Lai and his ruling Democratic Progressive Party aimed at pushing a pro-independence agenda. While previous Han Kuang exercises also had civil defence components, this year authorities have combined them in a single Urban Resilience exercise across the island which began on Tuesday and ends on Friday. Each day of the exercise sees air raid sirens ringing out for half an hour in several cities. Residents in designated areas in each city must shelter indoors or risk incurring a fine. All shops and restaurants must also pause operations. Road traffic must also come to a stop, with drivers required to pull over and head indoors immediately. In Taipei, hundreds of emergency workers and volunteers took part in air raid drills and evacuations at a busy temple square, schools, subway stations and highways. They also held a mock mass casualty event simulating missile or bomb strikes on buildings, where emergency personnel pulled out survivors and treated their injuries, and set up distribution points for emergency supplies.\n\nIn Taipei, hundreds of emergency workers and volunteers took part in air raid drills and evacuations\n\nThis week's Urban Resilience exercise is the latest civil defence drill Taiwan has held this year as it tries to prepare its cities for possible attacks and raise its population's defence awareness. While US officials have warned of an imminent threat from China and that President Xi Jinping wants his military to be capable of invading Taiwan by 2027, most Taiwanese remain sceptical that an actual invasion will take place. One poll done last October by a government-linked think tank, the Institute for National Defence and Security Research (INDSR), found that more than 60% of Taiwanese do not believe China will invade in the next five years. \"The chances of China invading are low. If they really wanted to invade us, they would have done it long ago,\" said Ben, a 29-year-old finance professional interviewed by the BBC in Taipei on Wednesday. \"But I do believe we need these drills, every country needs it and you need to practise your defence… I believe there is still a threat from China.\" Others were more sceptical. \"There is just too big a difference in the strengths of China and Taiwan's militaries,\" said Mr Xue, a 48-year-old office worker. \"There is no use defending ourselves against an attack.\" The IDSR poll had found that only half of Taiwan's population had confidence in their armed forces' capability to defend the island.

    "text": "Who are the Druze and why is Israel attacking Syria?\n\n17 hours ago Share Save Tess Mallinder Heron BBC Monitoring Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nA fresh wave of deadly sectarian violence has rocked Syria, putting into focus the country's fragile security landscape as the new government attempts to impose its authority over the fractured territory. On Sunday 13 July, the reported abduction of a merchant from the Druze minority sparked days of deadly clashes between Druze militias and Sunni Bedouin fighters in southern Syria. Later on Tuesday 15 July, Israel intervened militarily, saying its forces were seeking to protect the Druze and to eliminate pro-government forces accused of attacking them in Suweida. At least 350 people are reported to have been killed in Suweida since Sunday, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The violence is the first in the Druze-majority province of Suweida since fighting in April and May between Druze fighters and Syria's new security forces killed dozens of people. Prior to this, clashes in Syria's coastal provinces in March were said to have killed hundreds of members of the Alawite minority, to which former ruler Bashar al-Assad belongs. The deadly unrest, along with the violent Israeli strikes, have re-ignited fears of a security breakdown in Syria, as the country grapples with the fallout from over a decade of civil war, and the recent Islamist-led rebel takeover of Damascus in December 2024. Syria's current leader, former jihadist Ahmed al-Sharaa, has vowed to protect Syria's minorities.\n\nWho are the Druze?\n\nThe Druze are an Arabic-speaking ethno-religious minority in Syria, Lebanon, Israel and the occupied Golan Heights. The Druze faith is an offshoot of Shia Islam with its own unique identity and beliefs. Half of its roughly one million followers live in Syria, where they make up about 3% of the population. The Druze community in Israel is largely considered to be loyal to the Israeli state, owing to its members' participation in military service. There are some 152,000 Druze people living in Israel and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, according to the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics. They have historically occupied a precarious position in Syria's political order. During Syria's almost 14-year civil war, the Druze operated their own militias in southern Syria. Since the fall of Assad in December, the Druze have resisted state attempts to impose authority over southern Syria. While the Druze factions in Syria are divided in their approach to the new authorities, ranging from caution to outright rejection, many object to official Syrian security presence in Suweida and have resisted integration into the Syrian army - relying instead on local militias.\n\nDespite the Syrian government condemning the recent attacks on Druze people and vowing to restore order in southern Syria, its forces have also been accused of attacking the minority - with the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) war monitor documenting \"summary executions\" of Druze people by government forces. Such reports have fuelled mistrust among some members of the Druze community towards the authorities in Damascus. After Assad's sudden fall, Israel has been reaching out to the Druze community near its northern border in a bid to forge alliances with Syria's minorities. It has increasingly positioned itself as a regional protector of minorities, including the Kurds, Druze and Alawites in Syria, while attacking military sites in Syria and government forces. During the sectarian clashes in May, Israel carried out strikes near the presidential palace in Damascus, saying it was a warning against attacks on the Druze. However, some Druze figures in Syria and Lebanon have accused Israel of stoking sectarian divisions to advance its own expansionist aspirations in the region.\n\nWhy is Israel attacking Syria now?\n\nThe most recent strikes have primarily acted as a warning and a deterrent against the Syrian army deploying to southern Syria, with Israel seeking to create a demilitarised zone in the area. In particular, Israel fears the presence of Islamist fighters near its northern border, along the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. While the Israeli air strikes on 15 July were limited to targeting security forces and vehicles in Suweida, the Israeli military expanded the scope of its attacks on 16 July, striking the Ministry of Defence and the Syrian army headquarters in Damascus. Syria has condemned the attacks. The strikes represented the most serious Israeli escalation in Syria since December 2024, when it obliterated hundreds of military sites across the country and seized a UN-patrolled buffer zone in the Syrian Golan Heights. Israel has struck Syria multiple times, with the intention of preventing the new authorities from building its military capacities - viewed as a potential threat to Israeli security. \"The warnings in Damascus have ended - now painful blows will come,\" Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz wrote on social media on 16 July, shortly after Israeli strikes on Damascus began. The targeting of the Syrian military headquarters was broadcast live by the leading Syria TV channel, from its studios located across from the building - with the presenter captured on air fleeing the studio.\n\nWatch: How a day of bombing unfolded in Damascus\n\nHow has the rest of the world reacted?\n\nThe US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said the US was \"very concerned\" about the violence and announced on 16 July: \"We have agreed on specific steps that will bring this troubling and horrifying situation to an end tonight.\" Several Arab states, including Lebanon, Iraq, Qatar, Jordan, Egypt, and Kuwait, have condemned the Israeli strikes targeting Syrian government and security forces. Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry denounced what it described as \"Israel's blatant attacks\" on Syria, while Iran described the attacks as \"all too predictable\". Turkey, a key stakeholder in post-Assad Syria, described the strikes as \"an act of sabotage against Syria's efforts to secure peace, stability and security\". UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also condemned Israel's \"escalatory\" strikes in Suweida and Damascus.\n\nWhat could happen next?",

    "text": "'Sparring in space' – BBC gains rare access to US base tracking global missile strikes\n\n1 day ago Share Save Jonathan Beale Defence correspondent Reporting from Buckley Space Force Base, Colorado Share Save\n\nWatch: US Space Force Guardians spring into action during training exercise\n\nThere's a short sharp shout: \"Launch Yemen!\" The men and women in uniform sitting in front of computers all respond in unison, \"Copy, launch Yemen.\" In the US Space Force, they're called Guardians, not troops. Staring into their screens at a base in the suburbs of Denver, Colorado, they're able to track a missile launch from anywhere in the world - and follow it from its launch site to its likely point of impact. We're the first international journalists to be allowed inside the US Space Force's missile warning and tracking operations room at Buckley Space Force base, a nerve centre where Guardians are on alert 24/7. They're surrounded by giant monitors which provide maps and data sent from a constellation of military satellites in space. These Guardians are the first to detect the infra-red heat signature when a missile is launched. Moments later there's another shout – \"Launch Iran\" - followed by a chorus of \"Copy launch Iran.\" This time, it's a drill. But last month they were doing it for real – when Iran fired a salvo of missiles towards the US military base at al-Udeid in Qatar, in response to US and Israeli strikes on Iran. Colonel Ann Hughes describes the mood on that day as \"heavy\". Unlike most launches, they'd been warned about that one in advance. They were able to track those Iranian missiles and then feed that information to the air defence batteries on the ground. \"Ultimately we saved the entire installation and the personnel that were there,\" she says, expressing relief.\n\nMatthew Goddard/BBC Lt Col Ann Hughes was relieved her unit was able to protect US soldiers in Qatar last month\n\nCol Hughes says they've been exceptionally busy in recent years, with wars raging in both the Middle East and Europe. When I ask her whether they've been giving warnings to Ukraine, Col Hughes says: \"We provide strategic and tactical missile warnings to all US and allied forces.\" The US won't publicly confirm it but it seems likely they might also have given Kyiv a heads up when it was about to come under Russian attack. Buckley Space Force base will form a key part of President Donald Trump's plans for a US missile defence shield, known as the Golden Dome. He has earmarked $175bn (£130bn) for the ambitious programme – inspired by Israel's Iron Dome air defence system. Many believe it will cost a lot more. But the foundations are already in place at Buckley. Its skyline is dominated by massive radomes, round covers which protect powerful satellite dishes inside. They look like giant golf balls on the horizon. These satellite arrays have detected radio frequency waves from a supernova 11,000 light years away. Lieutenant General David Miller, the commander of the US Space Operations Command, says the development of the Golden Dome, still in its early days, is a recognition of the increasing threats to the US homeland. He specifically mentions China and Russia. Both have developed hypersonic missiles which can travel at more than five times the speed of sound. Both have tested Fractional Orbital Bombardment Systems which are harder to track. \"The speed and physics associated with intercepting those requires the consideration of space-based interceptors,\" General Miller says. He prefers to talk about \"capabilities\" to defend America's interests, rather than weapons in space.\n\nMatthew Goddard/BBC There are some 12,000 satellites in orbit in space - and that number is expected to skyrocket\n\nThe creation of the US Space Force five years ago is proof that space is now a warfighting domain. President Trump launched the force in his first term, describing space as \"the world's newest war-fighting domain\". Both China and Russia have tested anti-satellite missiles, as well as ways of jamming their communications. General Miller says Russia has \"demonstrated the capability to potentially put a nuclear payload\" in space. He says space is already an area \"that is highly contested\", adding that \"we also have to be prepared for conflict in space\". Colonel Phoenix Hauser oversees the Space Forces Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance unit known as Delta 7. Their job is to find out what's happening in space. At their base near Colorado Spring, teams monitor screens showing thousands of small dots around the globe. There are already around 12,000 satellites in space. By the end of the decade that could grow to 60,000. Col Hauser says their primary focus is on China. \"It's the pacing threat,\" she says. China already has about a thousand satellites, half of them military ones. Over the next decade, Col Hauser says it will have tens of thousands more in low earth orbit. Space is increasingly congested and contested. \"We're already sparring in space,\" she says. \"We see close unprofessional and unsafe engagements from our adversaries.\" That includes satellites fitted with electronic jamming, lasers and even nets and grappling arms, which could be used to move another satellite off course. Some have suggested there are already \"dog fights\" taking place in space. \"I don't know that we're quite there in the type of Top Gun like dog fighting perspective,\" Col Hauser says. \"But it's something certainly that we need to be ready for.\"\n\nMatthew Goddard/BBC Col Phoenix Hauser (left) says the US has to be ready for conflict in space\n\nThe US Space Force is preparing for the possibility of conflict in space. Col Hauser says a year ago they \"weren't able to talk about having offensive space capabilities\". Now, she says their focus \"is to generate options for the president so that we can gain and maintain space superiority through offensive and defensive space control\". Gen Miller says the only way to prevent conflict is \"through strength and we have to have our own capabilities in order to defend our assets\". He won't give detail as to what that precisely means. But the recent US strikes on Iran's nuclear programme, Operation Midnight Hammer, gives a glimpse of what the US Space Force is already able to do. Those attacks by B-2 bombers also underline why continuing dominance in space remains crucial to the US military. \"You have to understand how much the United States military assumes the advantage that we derive from space,\" Gen Miller says. That includes the ability to navigate and communicate over the horizon, and to deliver precision strikes using GPS. The BBC has been given the first details about how US Space Force Guardians were involved in the operation. \"One of the things we did was leverage our electromagnetic warfare capability in order to ensure dominance throughout the operation\", Gen Miller says. The electro magnetic spectrum includes radio waves, microwaves, infra-red, and visible light. \"We knew the environment was going to be jammed,\" he says. The US Space Force ensured that jamming was denied so that US B-2 bombers could arrive at their target and deliver their GPS guided Massive Ordnance Bombs with precision.\n\nMatthew Goddard/BBC Space Force units are on alert 24 hours a day, seven days a week",

    "text": "Could axing two national holidays save France from its mountain of debt?\n\n1 day ago Share Save Hugh Schofield BBC News in Paris Share Save\n\nGetty Images The French have 11 public holidays a year, an average number for a European country\n\nPrime Minister François Bayrou has put the cat among the pigeons in promising to cut two of France's national holidays in order to rescue the country's finances. Predictably enough, his proposal on Tuesday to axe the Easter Monday and 8 May holidays triggered howls of protest from the left and the populist right – with his own centrists and the conservative right expressing at best guarded support. In a country with such a strong tradition of worker protest, the sudden removal of two statutory days off was never going to be an easy sell. Essentially, men and women would be made to work two extra days a year for no increase in salary. The gain in productivity would help pull the country out of its ever-deepening hole of debt.\n\nThe French are indeed very attached to their jours fériés. The month of May is awaited with glee every year, not just because it heralds spring – but also because of the succession of long weekends that regularly occur. If 1 May (Workers' Day) and 8 May, marking the end of World War Two, fall on a Tuesday or Thursday, then the weekends become four-day treats because the Monday and the Friday will automatically be taken as holiday too. On top of that there is Ascension (always a Thursday) plus Easter Monday and Whit Monday (or Pentecost). If the Church calendar obliges, an early Easter can combine with 1 or 8 May to provide not just a pont or bridge - meaning a four-day weekend spanning a Monday or Friday, but a veritable five or six-day viaduc (viaduct). November is another feast of feasts, with All Saints' on the first of the month and Armistice on the 11th offering relief from autumn blues. And on top of that, there are the famous \"RTT\" days, which many get in return for working more than the legal 35 hours a week. But before we lapse into humorous self-satisfaction about \"those incredibly lazy French and their God-given right to endless downtime\", we need to bear in mind a couple of other considerations. First, far from the popular image, the French actually have fewer national holidays than the European average. France has 11, like Germany and the US. Slovakia has the most, with 15, and England, Wales, and the Netherlands have the fewest, with 8. Ireland and Denmark have 10. Second, according to the UK's Office for National Statistics, French productivity (output per worker) is 18% higher than the UK's, So any gloating about holidays from across the Channel is misplaced. Third, this is not the first time in recent years that France has proposed to axe national holidays. It has happened before – and worked (kind of). In 2003, the conservative government under President Jacques Chirac wanted to do something radical after the deadly heatwave of that summer which killed 15,000 people. So Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin decided to turn Whit Monday into a Day of Solidarity. People would work instead of taking the day off, and the money gained by employers would be paid to the government for a fund to help the elderly and disabled. There was an outcry, and a few years later the change was watered down so that now the Day of Solidarity is voluntary. It is all highly confusing, and no-one really understands how it functions, but non-Whit Monday still generates €3bn (£2.6bn; $3.5bn) every year in receipts. Another precedent goes back to the 1950s and Charles de Gaulle.\n\nGetty Images Charles de Gaulle took office as president in 1959 and then axed a public holiday",

    "text": "Ramaphosa struggles to mend fences with Trump\n\n19 hours ago Share Save Farouk Chothia BBC News Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe Trump administration is treating South Africa almost like a pariah, blacklisting its envoys, refusing to send top-level officials to meetings it hosts, and threatening to hit the nation with such high tariffs that its economic crisis is likely to deepen. The latest sign of this came with the revelation by the second-biggest party in South Africa's coalition government, the Democratic Alliance (DA), that the US government had rejected President Cyril Ramaphosa's special envoy, denying him a diplomatic visa in May and refusing to recognise him as an \"official interlocutor\". Ramaphosa had created the post for Mcebisi Jonas, the non-executive chairman of mobile phone giant MTN and a respected former deputy finance minister, to improve South Africa's rock-bottom relationship with the US. Ramaphosa's spokesman accused the DA of \"disinformation\", but did not explicitly deny the party's claim. The US State Department declined to comment when contacted by the BBC, citing \"visa record confidentiality\". Jonas's appointment came after President Donald Trump had cut off aid to South Africa, accused Ramaphosa's government of persecuting white people, condemned it for binging a genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), and for \"reinvigorating\" relations with Iran - an implacable foe of the US. Priyal Singh, a South Africa foreign policy expert at the Pretoria-based Institute for Security Studies think-tank, told the BBC that if the DA's claims about Jonas were true, it would be in line with the Trump administration's strategy to give South Africa the \"cold shoulder, and cut off channels of communication that it so desperately needs\". The US has not only cut back bilateral relations with South Africa, but also boycotted it in global bodies like the G20 - which Ramaphosa currently chairs, hoping to advance the interests of developing nations in talks with the world's richest states. The latest sign of this was US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's decision to skip Thursday's meeting of G20 finance ministers in South Africa, preferring to send a lower-ranking official instead. Bessent skipped a similar meeting in February, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio stayed away from a meeting of G20 foreign ministers, saying Ramaphosa's government was doing \"very bad things\" and he could not \"coddle anti-Americanism\". Ramaphosa had hoped to get relations with the US back on an even keel after Trump invited him to the Oval Office in May - only for the US president to ambush him by showing footage and brandishing a sheaf of spurious reports to advance his widely discredited claim that a genocide was taking place against white people in South Africa.\n\nGallo Images/Getty Images Mcebisi Jonas is a widely respected former deputy finance minister\n\nJonas was strikingly absent from Ramaphosa's high-powered delegation, giving credence to the DA's claim that he was unwelcome in Washington. This put South Africa back to square one as the US had expelled its ambassador to Washington, Ebrahim Rasool, after he accused Trump, in a leaked speech given at a meeting of a think-tank, of \"mobilising a supremacism\" and trying to \"project white victimhood as a dog whistle\" as the white population faced becoming a minority in the US. In a politically odd decision, Ramaphosa left the post vacant, despite its significance, suggesting that his government had a dearth of well qualified career diplomats who could rebuild relations with South Africa's second-biggest trading partner.\n\nInstead, Ramaphosa pinned his hopes on a special envoy who, he said at the time of Jonas's appointment, would \"lead negotiations, foster strategic partnerships and engage with US government officials and private-sector leaders to promote our nation's interests\". But it is unclear how Ramaphosa expected Jonas to achieve this given that he, like Rasool, had made controversial remarks about Trump, calling him a \"racist\" and a \"narcissistic right-winger\" in a 2020 speech that came back to haunt him after his appointment. This was compounded by the fact that MTN had a 49% stake in Iran's telecom company IranCell, a major concern for the US. Compared to its previous stances, South Africa was \"more circumspect\" - as Mr Singh put it - in its response to US air strikes on Iran in June, merely saying that it viewed the conflict with \"great anxiety\" and hoped that it could be resolved through dialogue. W Gyude Moore, a policy analyst at the US-based Center for Global Development, told the BBC that it was not surprising that South Africa was in Trump's firing line. He pointed out that South Africa championed what Trump's support-base saw as \"woke culture\". For instance, Ramaphosa regarded the G20 as a forum through which to promote international \"solidarity, equality and sustainability\", which Rubio had opposed, equating it to \"diversity, equity and inclusion\", as well as climate change. Mr Moore said this was also borne out in the Trump's administration's attitude towards South Africa's \"black empowerment\" policy, accusing it of \"race-based discrimination\" against white people. Ramaphosa's government sees it as necessary to address the legacy of the racist system of apartheid. \"I cannot see how the differences can be resolved. South Africa will just have to carry on, and strengthen ties with other countries. It's not the only one in the crosshairs of the Trump administration,\" Mr Moore added. But it is a major blow to South Africa, as it had maintained strong trade and aid relations with successive Republican and Democratic administrations despite having sharp differences with them.\n\nGallo Images/Getty Images South Africa has a long history of supporting the Palestinians\n\nMr Singh pointed out that South Africa, for example, opposed the Republican George W Bush's war in Iraq and Afghanistan, but South Africa still benefited from Pepfar, the programme he had established to tackle HIV/Aids, until the Trump administration slashed funding earlier this year. \"The Trump administration is completely different, and caught everyone off-guard. South Africa will just have to weather out the storm, and try to mitigate the damage,\" Mr Singh said. But the economic consequences could be devastating - especially if Trump imposes 30% tariffs on South African goods from 1 August, as he has threatened to do. South Africa's central bank chief Lesetja Kganyago said the tariffs could lead to around 100,000 job losses - worrying for a country where the unemployment rate stands at a staggering 32.9%. The tariffs would hit South Africa's agriculture sector hard. This is ironic as Trump has portrayed himself as a champion of the country's Afrikaner farmers, offering them refugee status in the US. It also gives them an opportunity to farm in the US and boost its economy in line with Trump's \"America First\" policy.\n\nMore BBC stories on US-South Africa relations:\n\nGetty Images/BBC",

    "text": "Risky strategy for Trump as he escalates Epstein row with loyal supporters\n\n21 hours ago Share Save Anthony Zurcher • @awzurcher North America correspondent Share Save\n\nWatch: Trump calls out \"stupid Republicans\" in Jeffrey Epstein files saga\n\nAs Donald Trump continues to be dogged by questions about his administration's handling of possible files related to deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, he is relying on a tried and true strategy. The problem for the president, however, is that his plan of attack may inadvertently pit him against some of his most loyal supporters. In a lengthy Truth Social post on Wednesday morning, Trump began in a familiar way – by blaming the Epstein controversy on \"radical left Democrats\". This episode, he said, is just the latest in a long line of \"hoaxes\" fabricated by his political opponents to bring him down. \"These Scams and Hoaxes are all the Democrats are good at,\" he wrote. \"They are no good at governing, no good at policy, and no good at picking winning candidates.\" In the past, Trump has used this kind of us-against-them rhetoric to rally his supporters to his side – casting himself as the embattled champion of the outsiders and disaffected who faces off against the privileged and the wealthy. The potential flaw in the president's strategy this time became apparent halfway through his post, however, as he turned to blame his own party and his own supporters for falling for what he said was a leftist scheme. \"My PAST supporters have bought into this 'bullshit,' hook, line, and sinker,\" he wrote. \"They haven't learned their lesson, and probably never will.\"\n\nWatch: Trump says Pam Bondi should release 'credible' Epstein files\n\nDuring remarks later in the Oval Office, Trump continued to blame his own side, saying that \"some stupid Republicans, some foolish Republicans, have fallen into the net\". The president is drawing battle lines on the Epstein issue that divides his own side. It also risks cutting through the foundations on which his political strength is built. Trump's success has been powered by two central messages to his supporters – that he's an outsider who fights against a corrupt establishment and that he tells it like it is. At a time when many voters say they are tired of polished politicians with shifting views, Trump's base sees him as authentic – unvarnished and controversial, yes, but honest. Trump, never one to shy away from wild conspiracy theories or those who embrace them, now finds himself arguing that there is no \"credible\" evidence implicating the rich and powerful in the Epstein case and that those believing otherwise are suckers or fools. His shifting comments – that the Epstein files should be released, that there are no files, that any possible files are hoaxes – also make him seem less like a straight-shooter and more like a man with something to hide. He's left with the problem of trying to prove a negative. And for the moment, some of his supporters aren't buying it.\n\nIn an interview with Politico, conservative firebrand Laura Loomer warned that if Trump did not change course, the Epstein story could \"consume\" his presidency. Her advice to appoint an independent investigator to handle the case is one Trump would be loath to follow, given how he has railed against past special counsels. But the success of his strategy to blame political opponents may only work if Democrats take the bait. Dan Pfeiffier, who worked as a senior adviser to President Barack Obama, recently wrote they can avoid this trap by amplifying divisions in Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" ranks. \"If the issue becomes too associated with a Democratic effort to hurt Trump, it will polarise the issue along party lines and push the dissatisfied Maga voters back into Trump's camp,\" he wrote in his most recent newsletter. For the moment, calls for the government to share more information about Epstein is a rare source of consensus among the American public. A YouGov poll indicated that 79% of Americans want the government to release \"all documents it has\". That included 75% of Republican respondents and 85% of Democrats. An internal Democratic poll obtained by Politico found 58% of respondents believed Trump \"maybe was or definitely was\" involved in a cover-up. If the polls are decidedly tilted against Trump, Republican officeholders – the men and women who owe their professional livelihoods to staying in the president's good graces – mostly continue to stick by his side. Congressional Republicans are backing the president's legislative agenda despite their narrow majorities in key votes this week. And while some have called for more transparency, conservatives in the House of Representatives have repeatedly squelched Democratic attempts to mandate the release of all remaining Epstein files. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, who oversaw those efforts, walked back earlier comments calling for more Epstein files to be disclosed, saying that he was misquoted and that he only wanted the public to see \"credible\" information – the same language Trump has used. For the moment, the Epstein story is a frustrating distraction for a president used to bending the news cycle, and national attention, to his will. With Republicans in control of Washington, the controversy will only consume his presidency if Trump's own allies allow it to. If the grumbling and disaffection in Trump's faithful persist, however, it could exact a high toll on the Republican party in next year's midterm congressional elections, when voter enthusiasm typically determines which party prevails. And if Democrats wrest control of one or both chambers of Congress - and gain their accompanying investigatory powers - the Epstein files, and Trump's connection to them, could go from a political sideshow to centre-ring spectacle.",

    "text": "Canada's PM wants to fast-track 'nation building' - but can he?\n\n\"Ever since these laws were passed it's no longer about indigenous consultation, it's about consent,\" says Kataquapit. \"Consent on whether you are allowed to come into our home territories, our livelihoods and build whatever you want. The time for dialogue is over, and now it's time for action.\"\n\nAnd while it could bring billions of investment into places like the Ring of Fire, it could also undermine indigenous nations' rights to their own land, community members fear.\n\nNow, Prime Minister Mark Carney's \"nation-building\" law - his first major piece of legislation - is poised to put even more of a spotlight on the region. Dubbed the One Canadian Economy Act, the law was passed at a time when the country is involved in a costly trade war with the United States.\n\nJeronimo Kataquapit, a member of Ontario's Attawapiskat First Nation, is camped outside The Ring of Fire, a mineral-rich region located in remote northern Ontario. With just a canoe and a tent, the 20-year-old and his family have travelled more than 400 kilometres to protest a provincial law that designated the area a \"special economic zone\" for mining.\n\nOntario's Ring of Fire could be worth C$90bn in mineral deposits, according to media reports\n\nNo projects have been selected yet, but the government has hinted at a few items on its wish-list, including a pipeline along the British Columbia coast and a carbon-capture project in Alberta's oil sands. The Ring of Fire, a 5,000 square-kilometre area home to significant deposits of chromite, nickel, copper, gold, zinc, and other minerals, has also been flagged as an area ripe for development in partnership with the federal government\n\nBut while Carney's legislation was considered by many to be an early victory for the new prime minister, environmental groups have raised concerns that the law, and others like it, provide shortcuts to get through existing environmental processes. Meanwhile, indigenous leaders like Ontario Regional Chief Abram Benedict have argued the law undermines their territorial rights.\n\n\"We have environmental assessments based on indigenous teachings,\" says Benedict. \"We consider everything: air, land, water, medicines and animals. Time and time again we see project development that has not taken indigenous knowledge into consideration, and the project has essentially failed.\"\n\nConsultation with indigenous communities in Canada is not a courtesy, but law. The country's constitution affirms indigenous rights, and other law requires prior and informed consent on actions that affect their land and resources.\n\nBut what these consolations must entail has often been a fraught debate.\n\nSean Fraser, Canada's justice minister, has said First Nations' consultation \"stops short of a complete veto\" on projects. Meanwhile, critics such as indigenous governance expert Pamela Palmater argue the Supreme Court has made it clear that merely hearing out indigenous communities is not enough.\n\n\"The law is a duty to consult, accommodate concerns, and in many cases get consent,\" she said last month on the political podcast The Breach.\n\nWhen talks between the government and indigenous communities break down, it can be costly.\n\nCourt documents show that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police spent almost C$50m ($36m, £27m) policing resistance against pipeline projects in British Columbia.\n\nWhile in 2020, a Wet'suwet'en First Nation-led blockade against national railways – a protest against a British Columbia pipeline project - is estimated to have cost hundreds of millions of Canadian dollars a day.\n\nPressure is now building on the prime minister to bring indigenous groups to the table.\n\nCarney has said indigenous leadership is central to building a stronger economy, including through the One Canadian Economy Act and initiatives like the Indigenous Loan Guarantee Program. On Thursday, Carney he will sit down with First Nations leaders and later this month with Inuit and Metis groups.\n\nChief of Assembly First Nations Cindy Woodhouse Nepinak told the BBC that she had requested the upcoming consultations herself. The Assembly of First Nations held a virtual forum with chiefs across Canada last week with Woodhouse Nepinak saying they are \"united,\" and have proposed amendments to the law which they plan to bring up on Thursday.\n\nBut that might be too late, for some.",

    "text": "Why is South Korea retrying a spy chief who assassinated a president?\n\n1 day ago Share Save Suhnwook Lee BBC Korean Reporting from Seoul Share Save\n\nWatch: 1979 news report on the assassination of President Park Chung-hee\n\nTwo gunshots. That is how Yoo Seok-sul begins recounting the night of Friday, 26 October, 1979. A former security guard in the Korea Central Intelligence Agency, or KCIA, as the South's spy division was known, Yoo has many stories to tell. But this is perhaps the most infamous. He remembers the time - nearly 19:40 - and where he had been sitting - in the break room. He was resting after his shift guarding the entrance to the low-rise compound where President Park Chung-hee entertained his most trusted lieutenants. They called it the \"safe house\". In his 70s now, wiry with sharp eyes, Yoo speaks hesitantly at first - but it comes back to him quickly. After the first shots, more gunfire followed, he says. The guards were on high alert but they waited outside for orders. The president's security detail was inside, along with the KCIA's top agents. Then Yoo's boss, a KCIA officer who oversaw security for the safe house, stepped outside. \"He came over and asked me to bury something in the garden.\" It was two guns, bullets and a pair of shoes. Flustered, Yoo followed orders, he says. He did not know who had been shot, and he didn't ask. \"I never imagined that it was the president.\"\n\nNational Archives of Korea Kim Jae-kyu in military court during the trial in 1979\n\nThe guns Yoo buried were used to assassinate Park Chung-hee, who had ruled South Korea for the previous 18 years, longer than any president before or since. The man who shot him was his long-time friend Kim Jae-gyu, who ran the much-feared KCIA, a pillar of Park's dictatorship. That Friday shook South Korea, ending Park Chung-hee's stifling rule and ushering in another decade under the military. Kim was executed for insurrection, along with five others. Now, 46 years later, that night is back in the spotlight as a court retries Kim Jae-gyu to determine if his actions amounted to treason. He has remained a deeply polarising figure - some see him as a killer blinded by power and ambition, others as a patriot who sacrificed himself to set South Korea on the path to democracy. The president he killed is no less divisive, lauded for his country's economic rise and reviled for his authoritarian rule. Kim's family fought for the retrial, arguing that he cannot be remembered as a traitor. They will now have their day in the Seoul High Court - hearings began on Wednesday - just as impeached president Yoon Suk Yeol goes on trial for the same charge that sent Kim to the gallows. Yoon's martial law order last December was short-lived but it threw up questions about South Korean democracy - and that may influence how the country sees a man who shot dead a dictator he claimed was on the brink of unleashing carnage. Was Kim trying to seize power for himself or to spark a revolution, as he claimed in court?\n\nGetty Images Park Chung-hee ruled South Korea for 18 years\n\nWhen news of the shooting broke in the morning, it sent shockwaves through South Korea. Initial reports called it \"accidental\". What was left of Park's coterie tried to make sense of what had happened. Kim had been a close ally since Park seized power in a coup in 1961. They shared a hometown and had started out together at the military academy. Veteran journalist Cho Gab-je acknowledges that Kim seemed uncomfortable with some of Park's actions, but \"there's no record that Kim actually acted on those concerns, no evidence he released political prisoners, clashed with Park, or submitted formal objections\". Kim told the court he had thought about killing Park at least three times. But history shows he supported Park as he tightened his grip, abolishing direct presidential elections and term limits, allowing him to control the National Assembly and even suspend constitutional rights. \"My brother was never the kind of person who would commit such an act just to become president,\" insists his sister Kim Jung-sook, who is now 86. But he ran the KCIA, which was notorious for jailing, torturing and even framing innocent students, dissidents and opposition figures with false charges. \"They tortured people, fabricated charges, and imprisoned them… and if you criticised that, you'd get arrested too,\" says Father Ham Se-woong, who was imprisoned twice in the 1970s for criticising the government. Kim was not a saviour many could accept. But that is the mantle he took on, according to court transcripts that were not widely reported at the time. He told the judges he believed it was imperative to stop Park, whose ruthlessness could plunge South Korea into chaos and cost them a critical ally, the United States. \"I do not wish to beg for my life, as I have found a cause to die for,\" he said, although he asked the court to spare his men who followed his orders - \"innocent sheep\", he called them. He said he had hoped to pave the way for a peaceful transition of power, which had eluded his country so far. On hearing about this back then, even a fierce critic like Father Ham tried launching a campaign for him. \"He wanted to prevent further bloodshed. That's why we had to save him,\" he says. Father Ham ended up in prison again for his efforts, as the trial became a sensitive subject. The country was under martial law. Days after the trial started - on December 12 - the man who led the investigation into the assassination, General Chun Doo-hwan, seized power in a coup.\n\nSuhnwook Lee/ BBC News Kim Jung-sook has been fighting for years for a retrial of her brother's case\n\nProceedings in the military court moved at lightning speed. On 20 December, it convicted Kim of trying to seize power through murder, and six others of aiding him. Yoo was sentenced to three years in prison for hiding the guns. By 20 May the following year, Kim had lost his final appeal. Four days later he was hanged, along with four others. One was spared and another had been executed earlier. Kim died as the army brutally suppressed a pro-democracy uprising, killing 166 civilians in the city of Gwangju. \"I got the impression that Chun Doo-hwan was trying to quickly wrap up anything related to the previous regime in order to seize power for himself,\" says Kim Jung-sook. She says she saw her brother just once through all this, a week before he was executed: \"I think he sensed it might be the last time. So he bowed deeply to my mother as a goodbye.\" Yoo survived but he says after he was free, he was followed for years: \"I couldn't get a job. Even when I returned to my hometown, they kept tailing me. I couldn't say a word about the case.\" He now works as an attendant in a private parking lot outside Seoul. Ms Kim says her family did not speak up until about 10 years ago. After South Korea became a democracy, Park's image recovered, improved by time and wealth. His daughter became president, often defending his legacy for its economic record. It was her downfall - following massive protests over a corruption scandal - that threw open the door to revisit Kim Jae-gyu's conviction.\n\nNational Archives of Korea Kim Jae-gyu (L) and Park Chung-hee were close friends\n\n\"This case should never have gone to a military court because the assassination happened before martial law was declared,\" says Lee Sang-hee, the lawyer in charge of his retrial. She adds that the \"sloppy transcripts\" would have influenced his appeal because the defence was not allowed to record the proceedings. \"When I reviewed the documents, I couldn't understand how he could be convicted of insurrection when there was such little evidence. And above all, there was torture,\" she says, which the court cited as a valid reason when it agreed in February to a retrial. It accepted Kim's statement, which he submitted in his unsuccessful appeal in 1980, alleging \"the investigators beat me indiscriminately and used electric torture by wrapping an EE8 phone line around my fingers\". Reports at the time alleged that Kim Jae-gyu's wife had been detained and tortured too, along with her brother-in-law and brothers, which officials at the time denied. Now in her 90s, his wife has always been opposed to a retrial. \"She never talked about what she had gone through and trembles even now,\" Kim Jung-sook, the spy chief's sister, says. Ms Kim is resolute in her defence of her brother, repeatedly emphasising that \"he was a man of integrity\". \"Because we believe that he did not kill the president and his security chief for personal gain, we have been able to endure all of this.\"\n\nKim family Kim Jae-gyu is the first man standing from the left in this old family photo\n\nThe security chief was Cha Ji-cheol, who had been growing closer to Park, and often clashed with Kim as the two men vied for the president's ear. In the weeks before the assassination, they differed on how to deal with Kim Young-sam, an outspoken opposition leader who Park saw as a threat. In an interview with the New York Times, the opposition leader had called on the US to end Park's dictatorship. The National Assembly, controlled by Park, expelled him. The decision kicked off huge protests in Kim Young-Sam's strongholds. Cha wanted to crush the uprising, while Kim Jae-gyu advised caution, which would also reassure a Washington that was growing impatient with Park's rule. Kim told the court he warned against firing at protesters, which would only ignite anger - to which Cha said, \"three million died in Cambodia, and nothing happened. If we kill one million demonstrators, we'll be fine\". That evening at the safe house, the public broadcaster reported that the US ambassador was going to meet Kim Young-sam. An angry Park criticised Kim Jae-gyu for not arresting the opposition leader. When Kim pushed back, the court heard, Park retorted: \"The agency should be feared, it should prosecute those who deserve it.\"\n\nAlamy Kim holding a gun as he re-enacts the scene of the shooting, while investigating officers watch\n\nThey sat across from each other, sipping Scotch and sharing a meal. Park sat between two women, a popular singer and a young model. Cha and Park's chief of staff were also there. The terse exchanges continued, and mid-way through a love song, Kim Jae-gyu said, he pulled out the gun, aimed it at Park and told him he needed to change his politics: \"Sir, you should approach things with a more magnanimous vision.\" Turning to a shocked Cha, he cursed as he pulled the trigger, wounding him in the hand as Cha tried to block the shot. Then Kim fired into Park's chest. Outside, acting on his orders, KCIA agents shot dead the president's security detail - two were eating dinner, and two were on standby. Kim tried shooting the president again, but the pistol malfunctioned. He ran out to one of his men, who gave him a revolver. Then he returned. He killed a fleeing Cha, walked towards Park, who was leaning against the model as he bled, and shot him in the head. The two women left unharmed after being paid to keep quiet. The president's chief of staff was never targeted. Kim then went to the next building, where the army chief he had summoned earlier was waiting. The men left in a car for KCIA headquarters. It's likely he didn't argue with Kim - even a shoe-less, suspiciously rattled Kim was powerful, and his men guarded the compound. But en route he was persuaded to go to the army's headquarters, where he was arrested soon after midnight. Kim told the court he had planned to use the army, perhaps even impose martial law, to complete the \"revolution\" and transition to democracy. This is the crux of the retrial. The prosecution had argued it was a premeditated coup, while Kim claimed far loftier motives. But sceptics point to the lack of planning. The gun that jammed was plucked from a safe before dinner, there were enough witnesses to derail the plot, and he did not seem to have a strategy for his \"revolution\". He did not even make it to the KCIA headquarters.\n\nAlamy Kim Jae-gyu during the trial",

    "text": "How Trump woke me up for surprise interview - and the key takeaways\n\n2 days ago Share Save Gary O'Donoghue Chief North America correspondent Share Save\n\nThe BBC's Gary O'Donoghue shares the story behind his exclusive telephone interview with Donald Trump.\n\nDonald Trump makes a habit of calling reporters out of the blue. The US president seems to prefer an off-the-cuff telephone conversation to a sit-down interview on camera. On Monday evening it was my turn. And I'll be frank with you - I was asleep when the White House rang. I'd spent the best part of five days believing there was an outside chance I would get an interview with him, to mark a year since the attempt on his life in Butler, Pennsylvania. My reporting from that shooting had made global headlines and probably caught the president's attention. So I judged that perhaps that connection might be a way of securing a presidential interview - pretty rare things for foreign news organisations in the US. On Sunday night I was told I was minutes away from the call so my team and I were standing by ready to record, but it didn't come. By last night, I'd given up on the interview happening and after a long few weeks on the road without a day off, I was exhausted and taking a nap. Then the phone rang. I blearily answered, and the voice of Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt came over the speaker: \"Hi Gary, I'm here with the president, here you go.\" I dashed into my living room, scrambling for my digital recorder; the line dropped and I thought I'd lost it. But they came back on the line and I spent almost 20 minutes speaking to Trump about everything from that fateful night in Butler, to his frustrations with Vladimir Putin, to his new-found belief in Nato and to his view of the UK. Here are my five key takeaways from our surprise conversation.\n\n1. Trump shows a different side, touching on Butler\n\nHe was very reflective on a couple of things and he sounded pretty vulnerable talking about the assassination attempt - it's clear he's uncomfortable talking about that. For a president loved by his supporters for speaking so frankly and without a filter, there were moments of reflection and some long pauses before answers that the public rarely sees. When asked if the assassination attempt had changed him, the president conveyed a hint of vulnerability as he said he tries to think about it as little as he can. \"I don't like dwelling on it because if I did, it would be, you know, might be life-changing, I don't want it to have to be that.\" Elaborating, he said he liked \"the power of positive thinking, or the power of positive non-thinking\". There was also a very long pause when I asked him if he trusted Russian President Vladimir Putin. Eventually he replied: \"I trust almost nobody to be honest with you.\" I'm 'disappointed but not done' with Putin, Trump says\n\nListen to the full interview on BBC Sounds\n\n2. No commitment to US deportation numbers\n\nTurning to domestic American politics, I asked whether the president's plan for mass deportations was working - both in terms of speed, and given that some individuals were being swept up who the president perhaps wouldn't want to see deported. The president insisted his team had done a \"great job\" at fulfilling his campaign promises, citing the drastic decrease in migrants crossing into the US from southern neighbour Mexico. Some of Trump's team have expressed frustration that deportations are being carried out too slowly. When I pushed him on the question of how many deportations in this second presidential term would mark a success, Trump refused to give a figure. \"Well I don't put a number on but I want to get the criminals out quickly, and we're doing that, as you know,\" he said. \"We're bringing them to El Salvador, lots of other places.\"\n\n3. More frustration with Putin\n\nListen: ‘I don't like dwelling’ on the assassination attempt, Trump tells BBC\n\nTrump expressed his frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin - capping off a day in which he threatened to hit Moscow's economy with secondary sanctions if a deal over the war in Ukraine was not reached within 50 days. Having campaigned on a promise to quickly end the war, Trump seemed perplexed that he had not yet managed to strike an agreement with his Russian counterpart to end the years-long conflict. He again indicated there was a gap between words and actions on Putin's part: \"I thought we had a deal done four times and then you go home, and you see, just attacked a nursing home or something in Kyiv. I said: 'What the hell was that all about?'\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and other European leaders have long accused Putin of not being serious about ending the war. To them, feelings of doubt will be nothing new. But, when I asked Trump whether he had finished with the Russian leader, he continued to leave the door open: \"I'm not done with him, but I'm disappointed in him.\"\n\nListen: I'm 'disappointed but not done' with Putin, Trump tells BBC\n\n4. New tone on Nato\n\nI pointed out to Trump that he once suggested Nato was obsolete, and he replied that he now thought the Western military alliance was \"becoming the opposite of that\". He was fresh from hosting Nato chief Mark Rutte - a man he seems to be able to work well with. The pair exchanged warm words in front of the world's cameras, and announced that the US would sell weapons to Nato which would then be passed on to Kyiv. During our call, Trump indicated that he was shaking off his grudge that his country spent proportionately more on defence than its allies. \"It was very unfair because the United States paid for almost a hundred percent of it, but now they're paying their own bills and I think that's much better,\" he said, appearing to refer to a pledge last month by Nato members to ramp up defence spending to 5% of each country's economic output. \"We changed Nato a lot,\" he told me.\n\n5. Respect for Starmer and UK\n\nTrump emphasised his respect for the UK and its prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer, with whom he last month signed an agreement to remove some trade barriers. \"I really like the prime minister a lot, even though he's a liberal,\" Trump explained. Trump emphasised that the relationship between the two countries was just as \"special\" as many Britons like to believe, adding that he believed the UK would fight alongside the US in a war. He sounded relaxed over perceived slights against him. Although his state visit to the UK later this year will not entail a speech to Parliament, he was not insistent that lawmakers be recalled. \"Let them go and have a good time,\" he said. Trump labelled his future host King Charles \"a great gentleman\". He shrugged off a recent speech that was given to Canada's parliament by the monarch that was seen as an endorsement of Canadian sovereignty in the face of Trump's threats. He even had a joke. \"You have many different names you go by,\" he said. \"England, if you want to cut off a couple of areas. And you go UK, and you have Britain and you have Great Britain. You got more names than any other country in history, I think.\"",

    "text": "Ukrainians unimpressed by Trump's 50-day ultimatum to Putin\n\nUkraine's capital has seen a big increase in Russian drone and missile attacks in recent weeks (file photo)\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky spoke to Trump after the president said \"top-of-the-line weapons\" would be sent from the US via Nato partners in Europe, and thanked him for his \"willingness to support Ukraine\". If implemented, the \"secondary tariffs\" would hit countries that buy Russia's oil exports.\n\nOne of Ukraine's most prominent politicians, Kyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko, asked \"why such a delay?\" while speaking on German television. Russian attacks had become \"more intense\", he said, and more people could be killed in that 50-day period.\n\nSo, US President Donald Trump's decision to give Russia 50 days to agree to a ceasefire or face \"very severe tariffs… at about 100%\" has not gone down well.\n\nUkrainians are tired, run down by the emotional toll of the invasion and the physical toll of sleepless nights due to air raid sirens, explosions and the screeching sounds of attack drones. \"It was a long night,\" is a common remark you will hear in Kyiv.\n\nMore than 230 civilians were killed in Ukraine last month and many more wounded, according to UN human rights monitors - the biggest number for three years, as Russia unleashed record numbers of drone and missile attacks.\n\n\"It is very hard and very personal for us because we don't know if some of us will survive for these 50 days,\" she told the BBC.\n\nBut Ukrainian MP Kira Rudik says Trump's announcement was \"bitttersweet\", as it gave Putin another 50 days to continue his deadly bombardment and maintain his offensive on the front line.\n\nAmong the weapons being sent to Ukraine are Patriot air defence batteries to help protect cities from attack.\n\n\"[There] hasn't been a single fact that would prove Russia wants to stop the war. Ukraine is ready for an unconditional ceasefire, we have done everything by the book,\" Rudik added.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday that Trump's announcement was \"very serious\" and warned such decisions were seen by Kyiv \"not as a signal for peace but as a signal to continue the war\".\n\nThere was little faith in Trump's promises on the streets of Kyiv.\n\nResidents Yuliia and Alisa said they both worried about his relationship with the Kremlin.\n\n\"I don't believe it is real help for Ukraine… it's all about his ego,\" Yuliia told the BBC. \"I guess these four years [of Trump's presidency] are going to be very tough for Ukraine.\"\n\n\"Everything that happened during the last six months just proved that nothing will change despite what Trump does or does not say,\" Alisa added.\n\nNina, who also lives in Kyiv, was more optimistic that additional weapons sent by the US and paid for by Nato member states in Europe could \"speed up the end of the war\".\n\nIt could have come to an end sooner if Russia had not have been helped by allies like North Korea and China, she said.\n\nArtem, whose father is serving in the Ukrainian army, was \"hoping for the best\".\n\n\"People say a lot, let's see how it goes. I hope that everything will be the way we want. And we want peace, for the war in Ukraine to end, and for all the guys to return alive,\" he said.\n\nWalking around the wall encircling St Michael's monastery in Kyiv, photos of the fallen stare out at you - some were taken before the war, featuring men and women posing with family members and pets.\n\nAs Trump talks of imposing new tariffs on Russia, the war continues - with these images a reminder of the soldiers who will never come home.",

    "text": "As theories swirl about Air India crash, key details remain unknown\n\n2 days ago Share Save Theo Leggett International business correspondent Share Save\n\nAFP/Getty Images\n\nListen to Theo read this article While the preliminary report into what caused the loss of Air India Flight 171 last month has provided some answers, it has also prompted a wave of speculation about its cause. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner crashed into a building less than a minute after take-off from the city of Ahmedabad in western India en route to London, killing 241 people on board, along with 19 on the ground. One passenger survived. Information contained in India's Air Accident Investigation Bureau report, the first official account of what happened, has raised questions about the role of the pilots. However, experts within the aviation industry claim investigators have been highly selective in what they have chosen to say.\n\nWhat the report says\n\nUnder international protocols, the state leading an air accident investigation is meant to issue a preliminary report within 30 days. The 15-page document published by India's Air Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) on Saturday fulfils this requirement. Although the AAIB has been leading the investigation, US interests are also represented, because Boeing, the maker of the aircraft, and GE Aerospace, the engine manufacturer are American. The report does not set out any conclusions as to the cause of the accident. Nevertheless, it has sparked considerable controversy. In its account of the accident flight, the AAIB states that two fuel cut-off switches were moved from the \"run\" to the \"cut-off\" position seconds after take-off. This deprived the engines of fuel and caused them to lose thrust. Although data from the flight recorder shows the engines were subsequently restarted, it was too late to prevent the crash. These switches are normally only used to turn the engines on before a flight and off afterwards. They have a locking mechanism, which means they need to be pulled out before being flipped, a system designed to prevent accidental deployment. The report also states that one pilot asks the other \"why did you cut off?\", while his colleague responded that he \"did not do so\". However, it does not provide any direct transcript of the conversation, which would have been picked up by the cockpit voice recorder. Nor does it identify which pilot asked the question. It is worth remembering that preliminary reports are not intended to offer a full picture of what happened or draw firm conclusions. They are meant to be a factual summary of the information obtained in the early stages of what could be a lengthy investigation. The investigating authority is also under no obligation to make their preliminary reports public.\n\nReuters\n\nMissing information\n\nThe information released so far has prompted a number of commentators to claim, in the media and online, that the accident was the result of deliberate and intentional action by one of the pilots. It is a view that has attracted an angry response from the Indian Commercial Pilots' Association, which warned that \"invoking such a serious allegation based on incomplete or preliminary information is not only irresponsible – it is deeply insensitive to the individuals and families involved\". Don't vilify Air India crash crew: Indian pilots' association It added that: \"To casually suggest pilot suicide in the absence of verified evidence is a gross violation of ethical reporting\". In a memo to staff, the chief executive of Air India struck a similar note. Campbell Wilson warned against drawing \"premature conclusions\". Since the report was issued, the BBC has spoken to a range of people within the industry, including pilots, accident investigators and engineers. While theories as to what actually happened vary widely, the dominant view is that important information is currently missing. \"They've told us stuff they want us to know at the moment, and withheld what they don't want us to know,\" explained one pilot, who asked not to be identified. \"It's not a complete report.\" One of the main criticisms is the lack of a transcript from the cockpit voice recorder, which would enable the reported conversation between the pilots about the fuel cut-off switches to be put in context. Bjorn Fehrm, an aeronautical analyst at consultants Leeham Company said this was \"totally unacceptable\". \"They have all this technical detail. Then you have this reference to dialogue, but it doesn't even tell you who's speaking,\" he said. Mr Fehrm was also concerned that there was no reference to what happened in the cockpit between the switches being flipped from run to cut-off, and the first switch being pushed back into position to relight the first engine 10 seconds later. \"It's someone trying to hide something,\" he said.",
